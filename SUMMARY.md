# Project Summary

This document tracks major decisions, implementations, and changes throughout the Grazioso Rescue Finder project development.

---

## Project One: CRUD Module (Completed)

### Implementation
- Created `CRUD_Python_Module.py` with `AnimalShelter` class
- Implemented all four CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Connected to MongoDB database (`aac` database, `animals` collection)
- Used PyMongo as the official MongoDB driver for Python
- Followed PEP 8 standards and industry best practices

### Key Features
- Comprehensive error handling with safe return values (no exceptions to caller)
- Input validation before all database operations
- Type hints for all methods
- Auto-wrapping of update data in `$set` operator when no MongoDB operator present
- Duplicate prevention for `animal_id` field
- Connection pooling and timeout configuration

### Testing
- Created `ProjectOneTestScript.ipynb` with 18 comprehensive test cells
- Tested all CRUD operations with valid data, edge cases, and error conditions
- Verified authentication and connection security
- 100% success rate on all test cases

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with installation, usage, and examples
- Detailed docstrings for all methods with Args, Returns, and Examples
- Inline comments explaining MongoDB operations
- Screenshots demonstrating all test cases

## Project Two: Interactive Dashboard (In Progress)

### Phase 0: Foundation - Testing & CI/CD Infrastructure

#### Test Strategy Decision (2025-01-13)

**Original Plan:**
- Separate test files per CRUD operation (6 total files):
  - `test_crud_create.py`
  - `test_crud_read.py`
  - `test_crud_update.py`
  - `test_crud_delete.py`
  - `test_authentication.py`
  - `test_error_handling.py`

**Revised Strategy:**
- Consolidated test files (3 total files):
  - `test_crud.py` - All CRUD operations in one file with separate test classes
  - `test_authentication.py` - Authentication and connection tests
  - `test_error_handling.py` - Error handling and edge case tests

**Rationale for Change:**
1. **Better organization** - All CRUD operations test the same `AnimalShelter` class, so they belong together
2. **Reduced duplication** - Shared setUp/tearDown methods can be reused across test classes within the same file
3. **Follows unittest conventions** - One test file per module/class is standard practice
4. **Easier maintenance** - Fewer files to manage (3 vs 6) while maintaining clear separation via test classes
5. **Improved readability** - Related functionality stays together, making test suite easier to understand

**Test Class Structure in test_crud.py:**
```python
class TestCreate(unittest.TestCase):
    # Create operation tests with setUp/tearDown

class TestRead(unittest.TestCase):
    # Read operation tests with setUp/tearDown

class TestUpdate(unittest.TestCase):
    # Update operation tests with setUp/tearDown

class TestDelete(unittest.TestCase):
    # Delete operation tests with setUp/tearDown
```

#### Test Infrastructure Goals
- Convert Jupyter notebook tests to proper unittest modules
- Create fixtures directory with shared test data and base test classes
- Implement mocking for offline/CI testing (no live database required)
- Add environment variable to toggle between mock and real database
- Ensure all tests can run in isolation without network dependencies

#### CI/CD Strategy
- **Two-tier workflow approach:**
  - `on-push.yml` - Fast feedback (linting + unit tests only)
  - `on-pr.yml` - Thorough validation (linting + unit + integration tests)
- **Tooling:**
  - Python 3.13
  - ruff for linting (PEP 8 compliance)
  - unittest for test execution
  - pip caching for faster builds
- **Requirements:**
  - All tests must pass before merging
  - No network or database calls in CI environment
  - Mocked MongoDB connections for reproducible testing

## Development Practices

### Branch Strategy
- Feature branch per phase: `feature/phase0-testing-infrastructure`, `feature/phase1-data-normalization`, etc.
- Small, focused commits with descriptive messages
- Merge to main only after CI passes

### Commit Guidelines
- Commit often with logical units of work
- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits small and focused on single changes

### Documentation Maintenance
- Update TODO.md after every task completion
- Keep SUMMARY.md updated with major decisions and changes
- Maintain project documentation with architectural guidance for future development

## Next Steps

### Phase 0 Tasks (In Progress)
1. Create test directory structure
2. Convert CRUD tests from Jupyter notebook to unittest
3. Implement test fixtures and mocking
4. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
5. Verify all tests pass locally and in CI

### Future Phases (Planned)
- Phase 1: Data normalization helper functions
- Phase 2: Rescue type filter logic
- Phase 3: Authentication gate for dashboard
- Phase 4: Dashboard layout and UI components
- Phase 5: Interactive callbacks and controller logic
- Phase 6: Testing and validation
- Phase 7: Documentation and cleanup
